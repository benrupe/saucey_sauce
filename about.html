	<h2>About us</h2>
	<p>We created our BBQ brand in 2020. We came up with our sauces during a pandemic when we could find any BBQ sauce we emjoyed. We combined our thoughts together and made our brand with all of our quarantine time. With the help of Guy Fieri, we were able to create our own brand.</p>
	<p> Our goal as a company is to make sure that we bring the best BBQ sauce to all of you. With our unique recipe and unique style we guarntee better quality BBQ sauce or your money back guarnteed. We hope we can bring a great tasting BBQ to you.<p>
	<p>Located in Indianola, Iowa, our Saucey Sauce creation was made. After countless tries, we finally were able to create 4 delicious and <b><i>savory</i></b> flavors. We have one store opened for business on the square of Indianola. Our customers come from around the midwest to purchase our products.</p>
